## Project-idea: Improve GStreamer element to add support for properties

### **Project idea introduction.**

GStreamer element is used to use libcamera as a video source in the gstreamer pipeline. Libcamera can be used to stream video using gstreamer. The aim of this project is add more control over the aspects of the stream by adding support for properties in the GStreamer element
### **Warmup Task**

For the new open-source contributors who want to contribute in this project some warmup tasks were provided to make the new contributors familiar with the source code and how libcamera works behind the hood. All the project ideas have separate warm up tasks as I was interested in the project idea 'Improve GStreamer element to add support for properties' . I began with those tasks.
